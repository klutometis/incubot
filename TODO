* TODO context decay; in which interesting memes lingers between saws,
  and decay at a certain half life (i.e. they're effective count goes
  up until irrelevant); that way, they compete with subsequent memes.

  12:46 < TimMc> incubot: Where have all the flowers gone?
  12:46 < incubot> black and white flowers
  12:46 < TimMc> incubot: Yes, the very ones!
  12:46 < incubot> ML can be very fast in the right circumstances

  for instance, flowers would remain interesting.
** TODO the contex is a token associated with a timestamp; on subsequent
   saws: apply the decay (say one count per second delta); and shuffle
   the token in with the rest.

   for simplicity's sake: one context token? heuristics: an optimal
   sentence combines the context token with some new, interesting
   token. if unsuccessful: context token shuffled in with other
   tokens.
* Must redo index to include numbers; otherwise: rnrs, excluded,
  etc. Redo it, however, by loading all tokens into an in-memory
  hash-table; similarly with all saws (if possible). Do the correlation
  thus and output to a space-delimited file of token-saws; read that
  with sqlite3 via .import (minimize database work from scheme to live
  stuff).

  In fact, use scheme to do the tokenizing; use sort and uniq with
  count; awk to munge the columns; and finally sqlite .import to bring
  them in.

  Similarly with saws; use awk to increment a saw_id in the first
  column. Delimeter? Maybe tab; maybe other control character.

* Ask for irc password on command line; store naught in .scm
  (available compiled via strings).

* Need uidbasics to get host-name resolution; also resolv.conf?

* Need a permission-dropper (within bot?).

* Just grep the fucking saw-file! (Takes ~15 seconds per query; find
  another way to defer work?)

* Statically compile some SRFIs into incubot-read? Can't unless the
  eggs have been prepared statically, methinks.

* Cleanse environment variables before heading into chroot.

* Second daemon with db-write permissions listens to channel and does
  update, without compromising chroot.

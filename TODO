* Must redo index to include numbers; otherwise: rnrs, excluded,
  etc. Redo it, however, by loading all tokens into an in-memory
  hash-table; similarly with all saws (if possible). Do the correlation
  thus and output to a space-delimited file of token-saws; read that
  with sqlite3 via .import (minimize database work from scheme to live
  stuff).

  In fact, use scheme to do the tokenizing; use sort and uniq with
  count; awk to munge the columns; and finally sqlite .import to bring
  them in.

  Similarly with saws; use awk to increment a saw_id in the first
  column. Delimeter? Maybe tab; maybe other control character.

* Ask for irc password on command line; store naught in .scm
  (available compiled via strings).
